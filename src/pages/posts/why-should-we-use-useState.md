# Why should we use useState?

useState is a React hook that allows you to add state to your functional components. It is a powerful tool that can help
you manage the state of your application. In this post, we will discuss why you should use useState and how it can help
you build better React applications.

```typescript jsx
import {useState} from "react";

export default Counter()
{
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrement</button>
        </div>
    )
}
```

# What useReducer is and why you should use it in React?

useReducer is a React hook that allows you to manage complex state logic in your application. It is similar to useState,
but provides more control over how state is updated. In this post, we will discuss what useReducer is and why you should
use it in React.

```typescript jsx
import {useReducer} from "react";

export default Counter()
{
    const initialState = {count: 0};
    const reducer = (state, action) => {
        switch (action.type) {
            case 'increment':
                return {count: state.count + 1};
            case 'decrement':
                return {count: state.count - 1};
            default:
                return state;
        }
    };
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'increment'})}>Increment</button>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'decrement'})}>Decrement</button>
        </div>
    )
}

```

## 1. Complex state logic

One of the main reasons to use useReducer is to manage complex state logic in your application. With useReducer, you can
define custom state transitions and update logic, making it easier to manage state in more complex applications.

## 2. Predictability

useReducer also provides more predictability and control over how state is updated. By defining custom state transitions
and update logic, you can ensure that state updates are consistent and predictable, making it easier to debug and
maintain your application.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, useState and useReducer are powerful tools that can help you manage the state of your React applications.
By using these hooks, you can build more dynamic and interactive applications that are easier to maintain and debug.

If you are new to React or looking to improve your state management skills, I highly recommend learning how to use
useState and useReducer. They are essential tools for building modern React applications and can help you take your
skills to the next level.
