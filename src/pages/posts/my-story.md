## What is this place? and who are you?

This is my blog site. I try to publish my **little** reflections here.
I did not publish anything yet so we will see how it turns out.
About the second question I'm still trying to answer that question actually.
But I hope you will know me a little at the end of this article to have some idea about me.

## So you were saying story-telling? what about it?

Yes. Story-telling. I been always scared of writing and skeptic about it.
Sharing your thoughts on the go seemed a little scary to me.
Its a little hard to keep context and flow in balance.
**"So why did you start then?"** you might ask. I started to think that thinking and
writing is not so diffrent in the nature. We think like we talk or the other way around.
And if you think about it the train of thought have some flow and context.
so thats how i realised writing and thinking is not so diffrent but at least writing stay unlike thoughts

## Okay i kinda see it now. So who are you again?
